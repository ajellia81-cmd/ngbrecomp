/*
 * vcpu: one virtual CPU for guest threads.
 *
 * The Xbox has a single CPU and a priority scheduler: when a thread makes a
 * higher-priority thread ready (sets its event, resumes it), that thread runs
 * at once and the first one does not continue until it blocks. Titles depend
 * on it -- CRI's middleware resumes its server thread and reads the result
 * straight back -- and running guest threads truly in parallel turns those
 * assumptions into races that hang at random.
 *
 * So guest threads share one token. A thread holds it while it runs guest
 * code and gives it up when it blocks (compat waits, sleeps, contended locks,
 * suspension); the token goes to the highest-priority ready thread, first come
 * first served among equals. A thread that becomes ready above the holder's
 * priority preempts it: at once if the holder is in guest code, else when its
 * current kernel call returns. Equal priorities are time-sliced (10 ms), so a
 * spin-wait on a peer still lets the peer run.
 *
 * Host threads (GPU, audio, timers) never attach and are unaffected; every
 * function here is a no-op on a thread that has not attached.
