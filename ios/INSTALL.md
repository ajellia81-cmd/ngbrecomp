# Download and first-device test

This is an experimental real-engine build. No physical iPhone or LiveContainer
startup has been observed. A successful compile/package is not a gameplay result.

## Download the actual IPA

1. Open the [encrypted game artifact](https://github.com/ajellia81-cmd/ngbrecomp/actions/runs/40103624524/artifacts/12563917080)
   while signed into GitHub. It is from [Actions run 40103624524, attempt 2](https://github.com/ajellia81-cmd/ngbrecomp/actions/runs/40103624524).
2. Extract GitHub's outer ZIP. It contains `NinjaGaidenBlack-ios-arm64-unsigned.ipa.7z`.
3. Open the inner archive with a 7z-capable tool such as 7-Zip and enter the same
   password stored in `NGB_IPA_PASSWORD`. Do not upload the password to an issue or chat.
4. Extract `NinjaGaidenBlack-ios-arm64-unsigned.ipa`. Import this file, not the ZIP/7z.

The artifact is retained for seven days. The unsigned IPA is 14,239,945 bytes and
has SHA-256 `1f54f2e8514b3e234f9142567bbc938bb1242665210070689b54bc749bdce5f3`.
Build source commit: `9e28c13556311063e58d209c351f4e12bddb6916`.
It contains the real engine and 11,740 lifted game functions, not NGBBringup.
No game disc data is included. No developer certificate/provisioning profile is included.

## LiveContainer

If the host is not installed/configured, follow the
[official LiveContainer installation guide](https://livecontainer.github.io/docs/installation).
It describes the supported host setup and JIT-less certificate/diagnose workflow.
This project did not test or modify that setup and does not establish iOS 27 support.

In a configured LiveContainer, tap **+**, select the extracted IPA, then select
NGB Recomp and launch it. This is the standard import flow described in the
[official LiveContainer README](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer).
Use a normal foreground launch for the initial test.

## Game files and paths

The supported build uses the retail USA `default.xbe`, size **4,571,136 bytes**,
FNV-1a **0x3602ba6a6079c8cd**. The uploaded USA En/Ja executable matched this.
A different disc revision has not been established as compatible.

On first launch the app offers:

- **Import ISO:** select the owner's complete `.iso`/`.xiso` through Files. The
  existing in-process extractor copies the game data into the app's sandbox.
- **Import extracted game folder:** select the folder whose immediate contents
  include `default.xbe` and the rest of the extracted disc tree. The entire folder
  is copied; selecting only the small build XBE does not supply playable data.

The resulting layout is relative to the guest app's data container:

```text
Documents/
  game/
    default.xbe
    ...all other extracted game files and directories, preserving the disc tree...
  saves/
  config/
  shaders/
```

Environment mapping: `NGB_GAME_DIR=Documents/game`, `NGB_SAVE_DIR=Documents/saves`,
`NGB_CONFIG_DIR=Documents/config`, `NV2A_SHADER_CACHE=Documents/shaders` (all resolved
as absolute paths at runtime). The host LiveContainer's own Documents folder is
not automatically the guest's folder.

Keep the original complete ISO/data until game import and device startup have
been verified. The 4.57 MB Drive XBE is only a compilation input; retain it for
future builds. The large Drive ISO is no longer required by the build once the
small input is working, but retain at least one complete game-data copy elsewhere.

## Controls and first-run evidence

Connect a supported controller for SDL's native iOS GameController backend.
Without one, the native touch overlay supplies both sticks, D-pad, face buttons,
White/Black, triggers, stick clicks, Back and Start. Physical-controller detection
hides and detaches the touch controller. The iPhone UI and hotplug behavior have
not been tested on a real phone.

First verify whether the import UI appears, then whether the complete data is
accepted, the engine initializes and a title/game frame is rendered. If launch
fails, retain LiveContainer's error/crash details and the app log if present under
`Documents/saves/log.txt`. Report the device, iOS and LiveContainer versions and
which stage was reached; these distinguish loader, data, VM and renderer failures.
Do not include personal saves or game content in a public issue.

If files cannot be selected, enable the app-specific **Fix File Picker** option
in LiveContainer, then relaunch. The first device report confirmed this resolves
the inactive file selection even after broadening the app's file type filter.

The first device import reached 100%, and the following launch read the complete
4,571,136-byte XBE. It then exited at `CreateFileMapping failed (error 8)` before
the Xbox memory layout initialized. The iOS backing implementation now uses an
unlinked sandbox temporary file instead of named POSIX shared memory, and logs
the underlying OS error on failure. This change still needs a device retest;
do not delete and reimport the game data just to test the new IPA.

Keep the game in the foreground during initial testing: coordinated guest/GPU
background suspension/resume is unfinished. Real audio, rendering, timing and
120 Hz behavior also remain unverified. This IPA has not yet satisfied the
playable-on-iPhone completion criterion.
